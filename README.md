# Vue Bootcamp

1. Vue.js is a Javascript framework
   - Makes building interactive and reactive web frontends easier
   - For the browser (front-end)
1. What is Javascript?
   - A programming language supported by all browsers
   - Allows you to manipulate the already running page and provide richer user experiences
1. What is a framework?
   - A (third-party) library that exposes utility and functionality, and a set of rules
1. Reactive
   - App is able to react to user input, update the screen dynamically
1. Web frontends
   - 'What the user sees'
   - HTML + css + js in the browser
1. We don't send requests back and forth to the server to update the screen
   - We use JS instead

## Ways of Using Vue

1. Used to control parts of HTML pages, or entire pages
   - Don't have to use it for the whole page
   - 'Widget' approach on a multi-page app
   - (Some) pages are still rendered on and served by a backend server
1. Can be used to control the entire frontend of a web app
   - SPA approach
   - Server only sends one HTML page
   - Vue takes over after and controls the UI

## Vue Alternatives

1. React.js
   - Lean and focused component-based UI library (not a framework)
   - Certain features (routing) are added via community packages
1. Angular
   - Complete component-based UI
   - Lots of features
   - Uses TypeScript
   - Can be overkill for smaller projects
